# CodeAlpha_Tasks

**Task1(Student Grade Tracker)**
🚀 Task 1 Completed during my Internship at CodeAlpha 🚀

I developed a Student Grade Tracker program that allows teachers to easily input student grades and compute important statistics like the average, highest, and lowest scores. This project helped me hone my skills in Java programming and problem-solving while gaining hands-on experience at CodeAlpha.

**Task2(Online Quiz Platform)**

During my internship at CodeAlpha, I worked on an exciting project: creating a Simple Banking Application in Java. This task allowed me to apply and enhance my coding skills, particularly in using Java's core concepts such as:
1.Scanner class for user input
2.Loops and conditional statements
3.Methods for better code structure and reuse
4.Strings for handling user interactions

The app implements basic banking operations, including:
1.Deposits 🏦
2.Withdrawals 💸
3.Balance checking 💰
4.Exiting the system 🚪
